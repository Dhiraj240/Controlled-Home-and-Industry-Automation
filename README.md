In this project main focus is the overheating of electrical appliances in the house and power transformers in industry.In hot and arid regions like Rajasthan there is sure case of environmental impact in summers on the transformers.It has been proved that thermal damage due to a single high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) attack makes a transformer to destroy and damaged part of transformers are considered to be metal waste which causes pollution.In house when we use high power rating appliances like microwave or tandor there is sure case of heating of the switch which can cause a short circuit.Therefore we have developed a circuit using arduino uno and LM 35 temprature sensor which will sense or monitor its behavior according to the prescribed condition and the condition will be surrounding temperature.A limit for the temperature will be set accordingly and if the surroundings of any stated problem crosses it, e-mail or text message will be send via Android App to switch off the appliance and the respective individual can switch it off with an app or by physically.
